#### Note:

We have tried our best to clone Pulse Plus website but due to time constraint we were not able to build admin panel and some other functionalities.
We have also added some of our features in our cloned website like we have added extra product page and filters for that and also added our styling effects to make it better.
We think we put our best to clone this website as much as we can but but still if have any suggesstions then we will be happy to hear and look for them.
